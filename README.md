# Nahum Gebremedhin's Repository 


## About Me

I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Through my coursework, I have developed a strong foundation of software engineering skills including algorithms, data structures, and web development. I have direct experience working with programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++ as well as development tools like Git and GDB.

I also have experience working as the Secretary of the Ethiopian Student Association at the University where I did record keeping of meeting notes, as well as administrative support where I answered emails from other student organizations to help organize events.

These experiences have helped set me apart by allowing me opportunities to develop my communication skills alongside my technical skills. This combined with my ability to adapt quickly allows me to break down problems and solve them efficiently while keeping members of the team informed throughout the whole process. 

Currently, I am searching for a place to start my career after university and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real world problems and projects.
