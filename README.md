# Nahum Gebremedhin's Repository 


## About Me

I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Through my coursework, I have developed a strong foundation of software engineering skills including algorithms, data structures, and web development. I have direct experience working with programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++ as well as development tools like Git and GDB.

I also have experience working as the Secretary of the Ethiopian Student Association at the University where I did record keeping of meeting notes, as well as administrative support where I answered emails from other student organizations to help organize events.

These experiences have helped set me apart by allowing me opportunities to develop my communication skills alongside my technical skills. This combined with my ability to adapt quickly allows me to break down problems and solve them efficiently while keeping members of the team informed throughout the whole process. 

Currently, I am searching for a place to start my career after university and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real world problems and projects.


## Projects

Below are a list of projects included in the repository along with some information about them.

### Maze Project

This project uses Stacks and Queues to create and solve a basic maze given a set of guidelines. A stack is used to randomly generate a new maze given an input size. A queue will be used in the maze algorithm that finds a correct path through the maze. The stack and queue data structures were given to students along with some other files that can be found in the [write up pdf](https://github.com/nahum-gebremedhin/nahum-gebremedhin/blob/main/MazeProject/CSCI_1933_Project_4_SPRING_2020.pdf).

This project was completed in the Spring 2020 semester for my Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms course and was completed on my own. This project was done all in Java and can be run in the [MyMaze.java](https://github.com/nahum-gebremedhin/nahum-gebremedhin/blob/main/MazeProject/src/MyMaze.java) file where all of my own work was done. 

When you run the main method on line 204 of MyMaze.java you should get an output of 2 mazes of different sizes with each of them having a various number of asterisks. The path of asterisks represents the path the program took to solve the maze by going from the enterance on the top left to the exit on the bottom right of the maze.
